public To create a full-stack application using Java and Scrum, with options to add, delete, and search for a user-specified file, as well as navigation and application closure, you can follow these steps:

Project Setup:

Set up a new Java project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ).
Create the necessary package structure to organize your classes.
Scrum Planning:

Plan the development in sprints and define the tasks for each sprint.
Set sprint duration and goals.
Create a product backlog with user stories and prioritize them.
Create the Main Class:

Create a class, e.g., FileManagerApp, to serve as the entry point of your application.
Implement the main method inside this class.
User Interface:

Implement a console-based user interface to interact with the application.
Display a menu with options for adding, deleting, searching, navigating, and closing the application.
Use the Scanner class to read user input.
File Management Class:

Create a class, e.g., FileManager, to handle the file management functionality.
Maintain a collection (e.g., an ArrayList) to store the file names.
Implement methods for adding, deleting, and searching files based on user input.
Handle navigation and application closure options.
Integration:

Connect the user interface with the file management class.
Call the appropriate methods of the FileManager class based on the user's menu choices.
Display appropriate messages and handle any exceptions or errors gracefully. {
